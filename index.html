                    <h1>Homemade Drone</h1>
                    <p>This project involves the creation of a custom drone powered by an ESP32 microcontroller, featuring four motors and advanced sensors including the MPU6000, QMC5883L, and DPS310 for precise motion, orientation, and altitude control. The drone is operated remotely through a web-based interface, demonstrating a seamless integration of hardware and software for versatile aerial applications.
